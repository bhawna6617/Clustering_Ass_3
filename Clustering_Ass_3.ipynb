    "# Basic Concept of Clustering\n",
    "# Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that involves grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). The similarity can be defined based on various measures such as distance, density, or connectivity.\n",
